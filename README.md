# fan2c

### My FFL app using 
 - [Express JS](http://expressjs.com/) 4.x
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) >= 0.14.6
 - [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) >= 6
 - [Bootstrap (with Bootswatch)](https://bootswatch.com/paper/) 3.3.6

and plenty more (see `package.json` for details).

## Requirements

 - [node](https://nodejs.org) I'm using **>= 5.5.0**, so I suggest using that
     
### Semi-Requirements (if you want to use my npm scripts - see **package.json**)

 - screen - `sudo apt-get install screen`
 
## Pre-setup

#### Requires a bit of manual labor.  Most of it can be done by running:

```bash
sh grab-all.sh
```

However, some of these require different parameters (week and/or player number).  Those that don't have this requirement will be filled correctly.  The others can be obtained with:

```bash
sh grab.sh $TYPE $WEEK $PLAYER
    # ... as many times as necessary
sh extract.sh
```

`extract.sh` cleans up the JSON that is returned because it does some unnecessary nesting and adds extra data I don't need.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp config.json.blank config.json 
# ^...edit the config.json to match your league's settings
npm run build 
# ^ or build-dist, watch, or watch-dist
npm start
```

## Who this is for

Players and commissioners of [My Fantasy League](http://www.myfantasyleague.com/) teams/leagues.

Please give credit to any of the authors of the attributed packages in the package.json file appropriately.  They all work very hard and deserve some extra traffic :)
